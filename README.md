# Global-Climate-Data-Analysis-using-PCA-K-Means-Python-
This project explores global climate-related indicators from the World Bank Climate Change Indicators dataset to identify patterns and group countries into meaningful clusters.
It applies:
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction
- K-Means clustering for unsupervised country grouping
- Elbow + Silhouette analysis to select the best number of clusters
- The goal is to build an interpretable pipeline that reveals macro-level country archetypes based on climate, emissions, land exposure, and scale-related indicators.
